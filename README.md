# conifer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alexandrebouchard/conifer.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alexandrebouchard/conifer)


-------

Conifer contains utilities for doing phylogenetic inference.


Installation
------------

Prerequisite software:

- Java SDK 1.6+
- Gradle version 1.9+ (not tested on Gradle 2.0)

There are several options available to install the package:

### Use in eclipse

- Check out the source ``git clone git@github.com:zhaottcrystal/conifer.git``
- Type ``gradle eclipse`` from the root of the repository
- From eclipse:
- ``Import`` in ``File`` menu
- ``Import existing projects into workspace``
- Select the root
- Deselect ``Copy projects into workspace`` to avoid having duplicates

Phylogenetic inference using Conifer
-----------------------------

Let's first look at ``Conifer``, a framework where you can phylogenetic inference with amino acids sequences or DNA sequences.  This framework has incoporated several popular models such as K80 for DNA data or GTR models for both DNA and amino acid sequences. However, it is also flexible for you to customize your own selected features to define the rate matrix in the continuous time Markov chains (CTMCs) to perform phylogenetic inference. Moreover, it is general to incorporate new data types where your data can take more than one character to denote a state in the CTMCs. This is particular useful when modelling condon evolution or modelling of the co-evolution of groups of interacting amino acid residues.
